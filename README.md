# TeachyouSpeech

This is the file to my app, TeachyouSpeech.
TeachyouSpeech has one purpose and that is to help YOU learn, practice, or even polish on your publis speaking skills.
The best part; this is all happening at the comfort of your own privacy with real time feedback with AI.
All you have to do is get ready and click START! 
The app has the following pages: home page (index.html), the main service page (service.html), accessory page (acessory.html) and contact page (contact.html) with each having its corresponding css style page and some js files as well.
This is a beginner/intermediate level code.
Will hopefully expand this project and use advanced API's for effective and more accurate analysis and to be able to convert differnt languages to generate more accessibility to all people.
